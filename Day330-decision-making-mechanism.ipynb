An agent interacts with an environment, takes actions, gets rewards, and learns a policy that maximizes long-term reward.\n\nStrengths\n\nHandles uncertain, dynamic environments\n\nLearns from experience (no full model required)\n\nGood for continuous control and optimization problems\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSample-inefficient (needs lots of data)\n\nHard to guarantee safety or correctness\n\nLearned policies can be opaque (“black box”)\n\nTypical use cases\n\nRobotics control\n\nGames (Atari, Go)\n\nResource allocation, scheduling\n\nAutonomous navigation\n-HTN/PDDL(Hierarchal Task Network)  / (Planning Domain Definition Language)\nWhat it is\nBreaks high-level goals into smaller, ordered subtasks using predefined methods.\n-LLM(Large Language Model)\nPlanning Domain Definition Language :\nA formal language to describe states, actions, preconditions, and effects, enabling automated planners to generate action sequences.\nStrengths\n\nExplainable and deterministic\n\nStrong goal satisfaction guarantees\n\nExcellent for structured, rule-based domains\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRequires manual domain modeling\n\nBrittle when assumptions break\n\nPoor at handling uncertainty unless extended\n\nTypical use cases\n\nAutomated planning & scheduling\n\nRobotics task planning\n\nLogistics, manufacturing workflows\n\nMission planning (space, defense)\n\n\n3. LLM-Based Decision Making\n\nWhat it is\nUses a Large Language Model to reason, plan, or select actions via natural language prompts, chain-of-thought, or tool calling.\n\nStrengths\n\nExtremely flexible and general\n\nHandles open-ended reasoning\n\nNo explicit domain modeling required\n\nGreat for human-AI interaction\n\nWeaknesses\n\nProbabilistic (can hallucinate)\n\nWeak guarantees of correctness\n\nLimited long-horizon consistency without scaffolding\n\nTypical use cases\n\nAutonomous agents (ReAct, AutoGPT-style)\n\nDecision support systems\n\nNatural language planning\n\nMulti-tool orchestration","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}

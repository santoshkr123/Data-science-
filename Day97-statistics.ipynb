Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n🔸 Used for discrete random variables (e.g., number of heads when flipping a coin).\n\n🔢 It gives the probability of each possible outcome.\n\n📌 Example: P(X = 2) = 0.25 means the probability of getting value 2 is 0.25.\n\n🧠 Think: Counting distinct outcomes like dice rolls, coin tosses.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"3.

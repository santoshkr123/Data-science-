It helps computers understand, process and create human language in a way that makes sense and is useful.\n\nNLP is used by many applications that use language, such as text translation, voice recognition, text summarization and chatbots. You may have used some of these applications yourself, such as voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text software and customer service bots. NLP also helps businesses improve their efficiency, productivity and performance by simplifying complex tasks that involve language.\n\n*NLP Techniques\nNLP encompasses a wide array of techniques that aimed at enabling computers to process and understand human language. These tasks can be categorized into several broad areas, each addressing different aspects of language processing. Here are some of the key NLP techniques:\n1. Text Processing and Preprocessing\nTokenization: Dividing text into smaller units, such as words or sentences.\nStemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root forms.\nStopword Removal: Removing common words (like \"and\", \"the\", \"is\") that may not carry significant meaning.\nText Normalization: Standardizing text, including case normalization, removing punctuation and correcting spelling errors.\n\n2. Text Representation\nBag of Words (BoW): Representing text as a collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order but keeping track of word frequency.\nTerm Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): A statistic that reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.\nWord Embeddings: Using dense vector representations of words where semantically similar words are closer together in the vector space (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).\n\n3. Semantic Analysis\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities in text, such as names of people organizations, locations, dates, etc.\nWord Sense Disambiguation (WSD): Determining which meaning of a word is used in a given context.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}

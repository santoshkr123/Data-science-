Simple Reflex Agents • Description: Operate based on current percepts using condition-action rules (if-then rules). • Strengths: Fast, straightforward response without internal state. • Limitations: Lack memory or reasoning about past events, which limits their adaptability.\n\n2. Model-Based Reflex Agents • Description: Use an internal model of the world to handle partially observable environments. • Key Feature: Maintain an internal state that reflects aspects of the world not immediately visible. • Application: Useful in situations where the agent must infer the current state from past observations.\n\n3. Goal-Based Agents • Description: Work toward achieving specific goals rather than just reacting to the environment. • Key Feature: Incorporate a decision-making process that evaluates potential actions based on how well they help achieve a defined goal. • Benefits: More flexible and can handle complex tasks by planning multiple steps ahead. \n\n4. Autonomous Agents • Description: Operate independently in dynamic environments, making decisions and taking actions without continuous human oversight. • Key Feature: Possess a high level of decision-making capability and can adapt to changing circumstances. • Examples: Drones, self-driving cars, and automated trading systems.\n\nAgentic AI Agentic AI refers to systems that behave like autonomous agents. They’re designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and act on their own to achieve specific goals without needing step by-step human instruction.\n\nKey Characteristics: \n  Autonomy\nGoal-Oriented Behavior\nLearning and Adaptation\nPerception and Decision Making\n\nSingle-Agent and Multi-Agent Model: \nSingle-Agent Model:\n Definition: In a single-agent model, one autonomous entity (the agent) interacts with an environment to achieve a specific goal. The agent observes its surroundings, makes decisions, and takes actions to maximize its performance or achieve its objectives. Example: A robot vacuum cleaner operating on its own in a living room \n\nMulti-Agent Model:\n Definition: In a multi-agent model, multiple autonomous agents operate in a shared environment. These agents interact with one another and may have independent or overlapping goals, leading to cooperative, competitive, or mixed interactions Example: Autonomous drones coordinating to map an area or perform search and rescue.\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}

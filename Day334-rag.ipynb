In essence, RAG allows generative AI models to access, process, and incorporate up-to-date and relevant information from authoritative sources before generating a response. This overcomes some of the inherent limitations of LLMs, which are typically trained on a fixed dataset and can, therefore, lack knowledge of recent events or specific domain-specific information. \n\nRAG is a technique that combines two components: \n• Retriever: Finds relevant documents from a database or vector store. \n• Generator: Uses an LLM to answer questions based on those documents.
